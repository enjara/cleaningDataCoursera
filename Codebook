Below an explanation of the data and transformations used to create the tidy data set for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The original data was obtained from the following URL along with its description:

Dataset provided info:

    Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
    Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
    A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
    Its activity label.
    An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

From this a set of instructions was followed, to obtain a final tidy dataset. Briefly: 

    Obtaining data from the web, save them and make them readable by R
    Merging the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
    Extract the columns with mean and standard deviation in their names
    Replace the indexes with descritive names for the activities in the dataset
    Create an independent dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Final dataset structure:

  30 obs. of  81 variables. The first two are integers and the others are numeric.
